test2.ino is our embedded code for CC3200 processor.
It was developed in C under Energia IDE. No external library is required but Energia IDE is required to run this code since Energia IDE has its own custom CC3200 library.
Energia is available at http://energia.nu/. I tried to upload the software to collab with the libraries but collab was preventing from uploading and the software is quite large.
